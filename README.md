# scheme-chicken-hyde

[Hyde](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/hyde) is a static site generator written by scheme language CHICKEN.

## what this repository for

Hyde offers limited things, so I added following items.

- toc (table of contents)
- list all posts
- tags cloud
- list of posts grouped by tag
- related articles
- pretty url 
- date string from file name
- keyword search
- sitemap
- rss

## to use
I modified Hyde egg. So you need to install Hyde locally.
```bash
cd eggs/hyde
chicken-install
```
